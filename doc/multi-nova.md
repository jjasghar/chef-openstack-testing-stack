# Multi node with Nova networking

## Nodes

The multi-node environments will have four machines `controller`,`compute1`,`compute2`, and `compute3`.

## Networking setup

Changes need to be made to the multi-nova.rb and the environments\vagrant-multi-nova.json file.

### Bridge IP Address

The ip address used for the bridge should on the same network as your machine connects to the internet.
For example, on my home network, my laptop as and ip of 192.168.1.xxx, so I set the bridge address to
192.168.1.60.  Make this change in the multi-nova.rb and the environments\vagrant-multi-nova.json files.

### Device interface

The device interface must be is specified by name in the multi-nova.rb file.
There are two places to change, look for `<put your interface device name here>`.

+ For Windows 7, open the Control Panel, Network and Internet, Network Connections.  Look in the Connectivity column for a row with "Internet access", and use the "Device Name". For example, 'Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6205'.
+ For Mac, this works from some: 'en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)'
+ For Linux, ...TODO...
